God of beginnings, choices and doorways (Jay-nus)

Distinguishing features: Kind of hard to miss Janus, since he has two faces.
He can be a pain, since he can never make up his mind and tends to argue with himself.
 On the bright side, he can sing a solo in two-part harmony.

Now: Janus likes to dress as a New York City doorman. He shows up just when heroes
have an important choice to make, usually offering them two doors to choose from.
At least one of the doors typically leads to a nasty death. Janus isn’t all bad.
He can open many doors and he stands for new beginnings, but think carefully
before making choices.Janus won’t let you change your mind.
